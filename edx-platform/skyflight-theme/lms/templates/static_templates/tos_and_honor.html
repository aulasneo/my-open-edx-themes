<p><strong>CERTIFICATES, ETC.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Generally.</strong> Aulasneo and the colleges, universities and other institutions providing courses on the Site (collectively, the "Members") may offer a certificate of achievement or other acknowledgment (a "Certificate") for students who, in their judgment, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course material. Certificates will be issued by Aulasneo under the name of the underlying Member from where the course originated, i.e. HarvardX, MITx, etc. The decision whether a Certificate will be awarded to a given student will be solely within the discretion of the awarding Member. Aulasneo and/or the Members providing courses on the Site may choose not to offer a Certificate for some courses.</p>

<p><strong>Registration and Payment.</strong> Subject to the foregoing, you may be required to pay a fee to receive an ID Verified Certificate of Achievement (a “Verified Certificate”) with respect to certain courses on the Site, in which case, the following processes and requirements shall apply:</p>

<ul><li>As part of your registration, you will be prompted to submit a photo of yourself, along with one other form of photo identification (“photo ID”). Although these items are collected by Aulasneo in accordance with these TOS and the Aulasneo <a href="../privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identify is performed by an Aulasneo third party service provider. Please refer to the <a href="../privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for additional details on how we handle those items once received by us.</li>
  <li>In addition, the processing of your payment information is done by an Aulasneo third party vendor, and you will be re-routed to a secure website to complete the payment transaction. The <a href="http://www.cybersource.com/privacy/">privacy statement</a> posted at the payment landing page operated by such third party vendor will govern the submission and processing of your payment details. Please familiarize yourself with those terms prior to initiating a transaction.</li>
  <li>Once your payment transaction is completed, you will be re-routed back to an Aulasneo confirmation page and will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from Aulasneo, as described below.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Course Withdrawal and Refunds.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Verified Certificate Track:&nbsp;</strong>For enrollment&nbsp;in the verified certificate track, you have a&nbsp;period of 14 days after your payment or 14 days after your course starts ("Drop Period") (up to 60 days after your payment) whichever comes second, during which&nbsp;you may withdraw or unregister from the course by clicking on the unenroll&nbsp;link on the student dashboard and request a refund by emailing <a href="mailto:cobros@aulasneo.com">cobros@aulasneo.com</a>. Please include your full name and order number in your email request. Refunds will be credited to the credit card used when you registered and may take up to two billing cycles to process. Aulasneo has no obligation to issue a refund after the Drop Period, but if you believe a refund is warranted, please email us at <a href="mailto:cobros@aulasneo.com">cobros@aulasneo.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional Education Courses:&nbsp;</strong>For enrollment in a Professional Education course, you have a period of 2 days after the course starts (up to 60 days after your payment)&nbsp;to unenroll&nbsp;from the course by&nbsp;clicking on the unenroll link on the student dashboard and request a refund by emailing <a href="mailto:cobros@aulasneo.com?subject=Refund">cobros@aulasneo.com</a>. Please include your full name and order number in your email request. Refunds will be credited to the credit card used when you registered and may take up to two billing cycles to process.&nbsp;Aulasneo has no obligation to issue a refund 2 days after a course start date, but if you believe a refund is warranted, please email us at <a href="mailto:cobros@aulasneo.com?subject=Refund">cobros@aulasneo.com</a>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>No Other Enrollment.</strong> When you take a course through Aulasneo, you will not be an applicant for admission to, or enrolled in, any degree program of the Member as a result of registering for or completing a course provided by such Member through Aulasneo. You will not be entitled to use any of the resources of the Member beyond the online courses provided on the Site, nor will you be eligible to receive student privileges or benefits provided to students enrolled in degree programs of the Member.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHENTICATION </strong></p>

<p>In order that Aulasneo can authenticate your identity as required by these TOS, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Once submitted to Aulasneo, this information will be subject to the Aulasneo <a href="../privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity. Acceptable forms of photo ID’s are:</p>

<ul><li>Government or State-issued driver’s license</li>
  <li>Passport</li>
  <li>National ID card</li>
  <li>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>In order to be accepted by Aulasneo, your photo ID must:</p>

<ul><li>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents and spaces)</li>
  <li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself</li>
  <li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted</li>
  <li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted</li>
</ul><p>Unfortunately, if you do not posses a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, edX is unable to provide you with an ID Verified Certificate at this time.</p>
